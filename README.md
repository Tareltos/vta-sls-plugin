serverless-single-page-app-plugin
A plugin for Serverless Framework, to simplify deploying Single Page Application using S3 and CloudFront.

Based on the official example, with some important tweaks:

Auto-generated bucket name, to allow multiple independent deployments without name-clashes
Packaged as its own repo, so that it can be re-used and independently versioned
